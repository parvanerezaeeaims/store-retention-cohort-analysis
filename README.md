# Customer Retention Cohort Analysis

This project analyzes customer retention over time and visualizes the results using a cohort-based heatmap.

## Description

We calculate the monthly retention rate of new customers based on their first purchase month. Each cohort consists of customers who made their first transaction in the same month. The retention rate is measured as the percentage of customers who continue to make at least one purchase in the following months.

A heatmap is used to visualize the retention rates:
- **Y-axis**: Month of the first purchase (cohort month)
- **X-axis**: Number of months since the first purchase
- **Values**: Percentage of customers retained
